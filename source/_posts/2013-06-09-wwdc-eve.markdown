'Twas the night before DubDub, when all thru the city, 

Lots of creatures were stirring about a new kitty. 

'13' jackets adorned on their backs with care, 

In hopes that Johnny Ive soon would be [there](http://instagram.com/p/aWoTw_H3ak/);  

Developers nestled all snug in their beds, 

While visions of iOS 7 danced in their heads...
